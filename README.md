JeevanBindhu is an online Blood Donation management system, which  is unlike other Blood donation management systems. JeevanBindhu recommends and suggests not to use the preservated blood which costs thousands and not affordable to everyone.
The interface is straightforward and free of cost.
The users are needed to sign up and log in to the website.
Just confirm whether you want to be a donor or you want to be a recipient.
JeevanBindhu encourages the live transfusion of blood from person to person without any third parties
The recipients will get the details of the donors based on locality and blood group selected
